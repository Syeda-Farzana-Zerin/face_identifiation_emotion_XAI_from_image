# face_identifiation_emotion_XAI_from_image
This repository provides an interactive Streamlit application for face identification and emotion recognition, enhanced with explainable AI (XAI) using Grad-CAM visualizations.  The project demonstrates how deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) make decisions on facial data, and visualizes where the model attends during predictions.
